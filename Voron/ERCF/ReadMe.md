# ERCF Updates

## Builds to date

1 - [ERCF V1](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject) (too floppy)

2 - [Sturdy Bunny Mod](https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/SturdyBunnyProject) (Better, but not perfect)

3 - Yes, I started to build a [Trad Rack](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/TradRack) but the BOM was way too complicated and that's a LOT of bearings.

4 - [ERCF V2](https://github.com/Carrot-collective/ERCF_v2) built and just let it sit as I was getting my TrIDEX up and working.  I lost interest for a while.

5 - I also started to build the [Box Turtle](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle) and then the [Night Owl](https://github.com/mjonuschat/NightOwl), but I have not ordered the parts I need for those as of yet.

I am looking into the [ERCF V3](https://github.com/Carrot-collective/ERCF_v3) but I have not started to print it yet.

# Status

I currently have the ERCF V2 connected to my 350 Trident, I am working through the setup now.  Adding all of the supporting parts to make this work.  If this one fails I will look into building the ERCF V3 or one of the other dozen MMUs that are now on Github,
