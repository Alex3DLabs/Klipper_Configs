Voron 2.4 V2

These are my current Klipper configs for My Voron 2.4 R2 350x350x350 Formbot kit.

Current Setup

Currently setup with a BTT Octopus V 1.2, with Afterburner setup, Clockwork V1 and an E3D V6.  Leveraging CANBus with a BTT U2C V2.1 & BTT EBB36 CAN V1.2 

Future Mods: Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder (ERCF) 9 Cart - Currently printing parts


Notes:
After installing the U2C and the EBB36 I originally used the ebb-canbus-v1.2.cfg file and called it out in the printer.cfg.  I stopped doing that and moved everything from ebb-canbus-v1.2.cfg into printer.cfg.  The reson I did that was becasuse I could not save my pid settings as it would error out notbeing able to save it to both files.
