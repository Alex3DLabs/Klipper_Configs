# M600 Filamanet change at layer


Add a filament change (m600) a the layer in your slicer and it will automatically pause the print when you need to change the filament, it will move the printhead to the front left corner and then unload the filament.  You just need to swap the filament to the next color, and manually extruded until the color runs clear, knock off any excess filament and hit resume.


Download the m600.cfg file, you know you want it.
