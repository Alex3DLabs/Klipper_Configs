Voron Switchwire (Ender 3 V2 mod)

I modifed my Ender 3 V2 in a Voron Switchwire with Stealthburner toolhead. I am using the following conversion (v2). https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW

This will turn the Ender from a dual lead screw bed slinger into a CoreXZ bed flinger.

The only parts I am reusinng from the original Ender 3 V2 are the Heated Bed (for now), the MeanWell power supply and the frame.  Everything else has been replaced.
