Voron Switchwire (Ender 3 V2 mod)

I am modifying my Ender 3 V2 in a Voron Switchwire using the following conversion. https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW

This will turn the Ender from a dual lead screw bed slinger into a CoreXZ bed slinger.

Parts I am reusinng from the original Ender 3 V2 are the Heated Bed, the MeanWell power supply and the frame.  Everything else is being replaced.

Parts being used:

BTT SKR Mini E3 V2

E3D Revo Six

Sherpa Mini or Orbiter 1.5 for the extruder

Stealthburner
