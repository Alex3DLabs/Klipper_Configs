# ERCF Updates

## Builds to date

1 - ERCF V1 (too floppy)

2 - Sturdy Bunny Mod (Better, but supports on files suck)

3 - Yes, I started to build a Trad Rack but the BOM was way too complicated and that's a LOT of bearings.

4 - ERCF V2 built and just let it sit as I was getting my TrIDEX up and working.  I lost interest for a while.

# Status

I currently have the ERCF V2 connected to my 350 Trident, I am working through the setup now.  Adding all of the supporting parts to make this work.  If this one fails I will look into building the ERCF V3 or one of the other dozen MMUs that are now on Github,
